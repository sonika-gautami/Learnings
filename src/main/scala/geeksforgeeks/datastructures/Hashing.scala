  /*

  //////////////
  Hash function:
  - A function that converts given key into small practical integer value
    This value is used as index in HashTable
  - Two properties:
    - Efficiently computable
    - Should uniformly distribute the keys [ possibly 1-1 ]

  HashTable:
  - Array Index = Hash Value (index converted from Hash)

  Collision Handling:
  - same hash key for multiple values
  - Chaining:
     hash table point to a linked list of records that have same hash function value
  - Open Addressing:


  Usages:
  - remove duplicates from a set of elements.
  - find frequency of all items
  - in web browsers, we can check visited urls using hashing.
  - In firewalls, we can use hashing to detect spam.
  - Hashing can be used in any situation where want search() insert() and delete() in O(1) time.
