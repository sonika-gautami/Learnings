//In Scala,
// it is possible to use the same symbol for both types and values.
//i.e
//val Ordering : scala.math.Ordering.type
//object Ordering { ... }

//Passing the ordering argument is not just verbose (it is not very verbose, actually),
// the problem is that the ordering argument can be systematically inferred from the type of the elements to sort.
// Because it is so systematic, could it be automated instead?
//implicit params
//The compiler infers the argument value based on its expected type.

//A method can have ONLY ONE implicit parameter-LIST, and it must be the LAST parameter list given.

/*The compiler searches for definitions that:
    have type T,
    are marked implicit,
    are visible at the point of the function call, or are defined in a COMPANION OBJECT associated with T.
 */

//Any val, lazy val, def, or object definition can be marked implicit.

// implicit definitions can take type parameters and implicit PARAMETERS

//for implicit, first scope(import/defined), if not found then, it looks for Companion object of that type-T

and X, because it is a parent type of Y.

//if more than one implicit definition are eligible, an ambiguity is reported
//Actually, several implicit definitions matching the same type donâ€™t generate an ambiguity if one is MORE SPECIFIC than the other.
